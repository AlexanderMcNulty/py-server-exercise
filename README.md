hello,

this is just some prework, for me to get the hang of python before I begin development on a python server.

the work featured in the first commit was sourced from this website. https://fragments.turtlemeat.com/pythonwebserver.php - His work did not come with a liscense so i have choosen not to have a liscense for this repository to avoid any liability. 

cheers
